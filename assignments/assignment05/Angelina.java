/**
    Six Degrees of Angelina Jolie.

    Some of the stuff I used in here is a little ahead of us. For
    example we have not formally covered maps yet. But I am sure
    you can nevertheless find your way around. :-)

    Do NOT USE MAPS in your code for BFS below! Trust us, you can
    make do just with the existing Graph interface and with Java's
    Queue interface (since BFS needs a queue internally).
